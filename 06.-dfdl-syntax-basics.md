# 6. DFDL Syntax Basics

Using DFDL, a data format is described by placing special annotations at various positions within an XML schema. A DFDL processor requires these annotations, along with the structural information of the enclosing XML schema, to make sense of the physical data model.

## 6.1 Namespaces

The xs:appinfo source URI http://www.ogf.org/dfdl/ is used to distinguish DFDL annotations from other annotations.

The element and attribute names in the DFDL syntax are in a namespace defined by the URI http://www.ogf.org/dfdl/dfdl-1.0/. All symbols in this namespace are reserved. DFDL implementations MUST NOT provide extensions to the DFDL standard using names in this namespace. Within this specification, the namespace prefix for DFDL is "dfdl" referring to the namespace http://www.ogf.org/dfdl/dfdl-1.0/.

Attributes on DFDL annotations that are not in the DFDL namespace or in no namespace are ignored.

A DFDL Schema document contains XML schema annotation elements that define and assign names to parts of the format specification. These names are defined using the target namespace of the schema document where they reside and are referenced using QNames in the usual manner. A DFDL schema document can include or import another schema document, and namespaces work in the usual manner for XML schema documents. The _schema_ as a whole includes all additional schema files referenced through import and include. Generally, in this specification, when we refer to the DFDL Schema we mean the schema as a whole. When we refer to a specific document, we will use the term DFDL Schema document.

## 6.2 The DFDL Annotation Elements

DFDL annotations must be positioned specifically where DFDL annotations are allowed within an XML schema document. These positions are known as annotation points. When an annotation is positioned at an annotation point, it binds some additional information to the schema component that encloses it. The description of a data format is achieved by correctly placing annotations on the structural components of the schema.

DFDL specifies a collection of annotations for different purposes. They are organized into three different annotation types: Format Annotations, Statement Annotations, and Defining Annotations

At any single annotation point of the schema there can be only one format annotation, but there can be several statement annotations. There are rules about which of these are allowed to co-exist which will be described in sections about those specific annotation types.

| Annotation Type | Annotation Element | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Format Annotation | dfdl:choice | Defines the physical data format properties of an xs:choice group. See section 7.1. |
|  | dfdl:element | Defines the physical data format properties of an xs:element and xs:element reference. See section 7.1. |
|  | dfdl:format | Defines the physical data format properties for multiple DFDL schema constructs. Used on an xs:schema and as a child of a dfdl:defineFormat annotation. This includes aspects such as the encodings, separators, and many more. See section 7.1. |
|  | dfdl:group | Defines the physical data format properties of an xs:group reference. See section 7.1. |
|  | dfdl:property | Used in the syntax of format annotations. See section 7.1.1.2. |
|  | dfdl:sequence | Defines the physical data format properties of an xs:sequence group. See section 7.1. |
|  | dfdl:simpleType | Defines the physical data format properties of an xs:simpleType. See section 7.1. |
|  | dfdl:escapeScheme | Defines the scheme by which quotation marks and escape characters can be specified. This is for use with delimited text formats. See section 7.6. |
| Statement Annotation | dfdl:assert | Defines a test to be used to ensure the data are well formed. Assert is used only when parsing data. See section 7.2.1 |
|  | dfdl:discriminator | Defines a test to be used when resolving a point of uncertainty such as choice branches or optional elements. A dfdl:discriminator is used only when parsing data to resolve the point of uncertainty to one of the alternatives. See section 7.4 |
|  | dfdl:newVariableInstance | Creates a new instance of a variable. See section 7.7.2 |
|  | dfdl:setVariable | Sets the value of a variable whose declaration is in scope See section 7.7.3 |
| Defining Annotation | dfdl:defineEscapeScheme | Defines a named, reusable escapeScheme See section 7.5 |
|  | dfdl:defineFormat | Defines a reusable data format by collecting together other annotations and associating them with a name that can be referenced from elsewhere. See section 7.2 |
|  | dfdl:defineVariable | Defines a variable that can be referenced elsewhere. This can be used to communicate a parameter from one part of processing to another part. See section 7.7 |

**Table 2 - DFDL Annotation Elements**

DFDL defining annotation elements may only appear at _top-level_, that is, as annotation children of the xs:schema element. The order of their appearance does not matter, nor does their position relative to other children of the xs:schema.

## 6.3 DFDL Properties

A DFDL _property_ is a specific DFDL attribute that tells the DFDL processor something about the data format.

Properties on DFDL annotations may have values of one or more of the following types

* Enumeration The property value is an XSD xs:token the value of which is one of the allowed values listed in the property description.

Example: the dfdl:lengthKind property, which has values taken from “delimited”, “fixed”, “explicit”, “implicit”, “prefixed”, “pattern”, and “endOfParent”. For example:

`lengthKind='delimited'`

* DFDL string literal: The property value represents a sequence of literal bytes or characters which represent data which appears in the data stream. The value type is a restriction of the XSD xs:token that further disallows the space character. DFDL entities must be used to express whitespace in a DFDL String Literal.

Example: the dfdl:terminator property, which expresses characters or bytes to be found in the data stream to mark the termination of an element or model group instance. An example terminator might be:

`terminator='%NL;'`

This uses DFDL’s string-literal character class entity syntax \(see Section 6.3.1.3\) to express that the element or model group is terminated by a line ending in the data stream.

* DFDL expression The property is an xs:string the value of which is a DFDL subset XPath 2.0 expression that returns a value derived from other property values and/or from the DFDL Infoset. Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed for DFDL expressions.

Example: the dfdl:occursCount property takes an expression which will commonly look in the Infoset via an expression, to obtain the count from another element. An example dfdl:occursCount property might be

`occursCount='{ ../hdr/count }'`

* DFDL regular expression The property is an xs:string the value of which is a regular expression that can be used as a pattern to calculate the length of an element by applying that pattern to the sequence of literal bytes or characters which appear in the data stream. Note that leading and trailing whitespace is not trimmed and is part of the regular expression value.

Example: the dfdl:lengthPattern property takes a regular expression which is used to scan the data stream for matching data. An example might be:

`lengthPattern="\w{1,5};"`

This scans the data stream for from 1 to 5 word-characters followed by a semi-colon character.

* Logical Value. The property value is a string that describes a logical value. The type of the logical value is one of the XML schema simple types. The string must conform to the XML schema lexical representation for the type.

Example: the dfdl:nilValue property can be used to provide a logical value that if it matches the element's logical value is used to indicate the data is nilled. For example:

`nilValue='0'`

* QName The property value is an XML Qualified Name as specified in "Namespaces in XML" [\[XMLNamespaces\]](29.-references.md)

Example: The dfdl:escapeSchemeRef property refers to a named escape scheme definition via its qualified name. For example:

`escapeSchemeRef='ex:backslashScheme'`

Some properties accept a list or union of types

* List of DFDL String Literals or Logical Values The property value is a whitespace separated list of the specified type. When parsing, if more than one string literal in the list matches the portion of the data stream being evaluated then the longest matching value in the list must be used. When unparsing, the first value in the list must be used. String literals containing whitespace or string literals representing the empty string must use character class entities in their syntax.

Example: The dfdl:separator property below indicates that the items of a sequence are separated either by a comma or a tab character.

`separator=', %HT;'`

* Union of types and expressions. The property value is a union of DFDL expression and exactly one of the other types. The expression must resolve to a value of the other type.

Example: Below are two examples of the dfdl:length property. One uses an expression, the other an unsigned integer.

`length='{ ../hdr/len }'`

`length='14'`

* Union of types. The property value is a union of two or more types. The type is often dependent on the value of another property.

For example, dfdl:nilValue can be a List of DFDL String Literals or a List of Logical Values depending on dfdl:nilKind. Another example is the dfdl:alignment property which can have as its value an unsigned integer or the distinguished enum value 'implicit'.

### 6.3.1 DFDL String Literals

DFDL String Literals represent a sequence of literal bytes or characters which appear in the data stream. This presents the following challenges

* the literal characters in the data stream might not be in the same character set encoding as the DFDL schema
* it may be necessary to specify a literal character which is not valid in an XML document
* it may be necessary to specify one or more raw byte values

A DFDL string literal can describe any of the following types of literal data in any combination:

* a single literal character in any encoding
* a string of literal characters in any encoding
* one or more characters from a set of related characters \(e.g. end-of-line characters\)
* a literal byte value

A DFDL string literal is therefore able to describe any arbitrary sequence of bytes and characters.

Details on how a string literal is matched against the data stream for parsing are given in Appendix C: Processing of DFDL String literals.

_**Empty String:**_ The special DFDL entity %ES; is provided for describing an empty string or an empty byte sequence. The %ES; entity is the only way to do this. A DFDL string literal with value "" \(the empty string\) is usually invalid. There are a few properties that explicitly allow an empty DFDL String Literal, and these properties assign a property-specific meaning to the empty string value.

_**Whitespace:**_ When whitespace must be used as part of a property value, the DFDL string literal must use entities \(such as %WSP;\) to represent the whitespace. \(This allows a property to represent lists of DFDL string literals by using literal spaces to separate list elements.\)

#### 6.3.1.1 Character strings in DFDL String Literals

A literal string in a DFDL Schema is written in the character set encoding specified by the XML directive that begins all XML documents:

`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>`

In this example, the DFDL schema is written in UTF-8, so any literal strings contained in it, and particularly string literals found in its representation property bindings in the format annotations, are expressed in UTF-8.

However, these strings are being used to describe features of text data that are commonly in other character set encodings. For example, we may have EBCDIC data that is comma separated. A comma in EBCDIC has a single-byte code unit of 0x6B in the data, the numeric value of which does not correspond to the Unicode character code for comma which is U+002C. However, when we indicate that an item is "," \(comma\) separated and we specify this using a string literal along with specifying the 'encoding' property to be 'ebcdic-cp-us' then this means that the data are separated by EBCDIC commas regardless of what character set encoding is used to write the DFDL Schema.

`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8">  
<xs:schema ... >  
 ...  
 <dfdl:format encoding="ebcdic-cp-us" separator=","/>  
 ...  
</xs:schema>`

When a DFDL processor uses the separator expressed in this manner, the string literal "," is translated into the character set encoding of the data it is separating as specified by the encoding property. Hence, in this case we would be searching the data for a character with codepoint 0x6B \(the EBCDIC comma\), not a UTF-8 or Unicode \(0x2C\) comma which is what exists in the DFDL schema document file.

#### 6.3.1.2 DFDL Character Entities, Character Class Entities, and Byte Values in String Literals

DFDL character entities specify a single Unicode character and provide a convenient way to specify code points that appear in the data stream but would be difficult to specify in XML strings. For example, common non-printable characters or code points, such as 0x00, that are not valid in XML documents. DFDL entities are based on XML entities, which can also be used in a DFDL schema. Examples:

s`eparator='%HT;'  
terminator='%WSP*;//'  
fillByte='%#x00;'  
textStringPadCharacter='%#x7F;'`

In some cases, regular XML character entities may be used instead. For example, the above '%\#x7F;' could be expressed as '&\#x7F;' but this is not always the case. There is no way in XSD to express the character code 0 \(i.e., the ASCII NUL code point\), even as an XML character entity; hence, one must often use DFDL character entities like '%\#x00;' above, or their named equivalents. The DFDL string literal syntax allows one to always use DFDL character entity syntax instead of jumping back and forth between XSD character entities and DFDL character entities.

The following grammar gives the syntax of DFDL String Literals generally, including the various kinds of entities.

Table 3 DFDL Character Entity, Character Class Entity, and Byte Value Entity Syntax

Using %% inserts a single literal "%" into the string literal. This "%" is subject to character set encoding translation as is any other character.

A HexadecimalCodePoint provides a hexadecimal representation of the character's code point in ISO/IEC 10646.

A DecimalCodePoint provides a decimal representation of the character's code point in ISO/IEC 10646.

A DfdlEntityName is one of the mnemonics given in the following tables.

Table 5 DFDL Character Class Entities

#### 6.3.1.4 DFDL Byte Value Entities in DFDL String Literals

DFDL byte-value entities provide a way to specify a single byte as it appears in the data stream without any character set encoding translation. To specify a string of byte values, a sequence of two or more byte-value entities must be used. The syntax is in Table 3 DFDL Character Entity, Character Class Entity, and Byte Value Entity Syntax above. Example:

`%#rFF;`

### 6.3.2 DFDL Expressions

Some DFDL properties allow DFDL expressions \(see Section 18 DFDL Expression Language\) to be used so that the property can be set dynamically at processing-time.

The general syntax of expressions is "{" expression "}"

The rules for recognizing DFDL expressions are

* Discard any leading and trailing whitespace.
* Must start with a '{' in the first position and end with '}' in the last position.
* '{' in any position other than the first is treated as a literal.
* '}' in any position other than the last position is treated as a literal.
* '{{' as the first characters are treated as the literal '{' and not as the start of a DFDL expression.

DFDL expressions reference other items in the Infoset or augmented Infoset using absolute or relative paths. Relative paths are evaluated when the component containing the expression is referenced not when it is declared. For example, a global element may have a DFDL property which is an expression that contains a relative path to another element. The relative path is evaluated when the global element is referenced from an element reference.

DFDL expressions that are used to provide the value of DFDL properties in the dfdl:format annotation on the top level xs:schema declaration must not contain relative paths.

### 6.3.3 DFDL Regular Expressions

The dfdl:lengthPattern property expects a regular expression to be specified. The DFDL Regular Expression language is defined in Section 19, DFDL Regular Expressions.

### 6.3.4 Enumerations in DFDL

Some DFDL properties accept an enumerated list of valid values. It is a Schema Definition Error if a value other than one of the enumerated values is specified. The case of the specified value must match the enumeration. An enumeration is of type string unless otherwise stated.
