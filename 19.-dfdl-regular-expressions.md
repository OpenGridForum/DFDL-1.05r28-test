# 19. DFDL Regular Expressions

A DFDL regular expression may be specified for the dfdl:lengthPattern format property and the dfdl:testPattern property of the dfdl:assert and dfdl:discriminator annotations. DFDL regular expressions do not interpret DFDL entities.

A DFDL regular expression is defined by a set of valid pattern characters. For portability, a DFDL regular expression pattern is restricted to the inclusive subset of the ICU regular expression [\[ICURegex\]](29.-references.md) and the Java\(R\) 7 regular expression [\[JavaRegex\]](29.-references.md) with the Unicode flags UNICODE\_CASE and UNICODE\_CHARACTER\_CLASS turned on. DFDL regular expressions thereby conform to Unicode Technical Standard \#18 , Unicode Regular Expressions, level 1 [\[UnicodeRegex\]](29.-references.md).

The following regular expression constructs are not common to both ICU and Java\(R\) 7 and it is a Schema Definition Error if any are used in a DFDL regular expression:  

| Construct | Meaning | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| \N{UNICODE CHARACTER NAME} | Match the named character | ICU only |
| \X | Match a Grapheme Cluster | ICU only |
| \Uhhhhhhhh | Match the character with the hex value hhhhhhhh | ICU only |
| \(?\# ... \) | Free-format comment | ICU only |
| \(?w-w\) | UREGEX\_UWORD - Controls the behaviour of \b in a pattern | ICU only |
| \(?d-d\) | UNIX\_LINES - Enables Unix lines mode | Java 7 only |
| \(?u-u\) | UNICODE\_CASE - Enables Unicode-aware case folding | Java 7 only \(1\) |
| \(?U-U\) | UNICODE\_CHARACTER\_CLASS - Enables the Unicode version of predefined character classes and POSIX  character classes | Java 7 only \(2\) |

Table 68 Disallowed Regular Expression Constructs

Notes:

1. Implementations using Java 7 MUST set flag UNICODE\_CASE by default to match ICU.
2. Implementations using Java 7 MUST set flag UNICODE\_CHARACTER\_CLASS by default to match ICU.

Additionally, the behaviour of the word character construct \(\w\) is not consistent in ICU and Java 7. In Java 7 \w is

 \[\p{Alpha}\p{gc=Mn}\p{gc=Me}\p{gc=Mc}\p{Digit}\p{gc=Pc}\],

which is a larger set than ICU where \w is

\[\p{Ll}\p{Lu}\p{Lt}\p{Lo}\p{Nd}\].  

The use of \w is NOT RECOMMENDED in DFDL regular expressions in conjunction with Unicode encodings, and an implementation MUST issue a warning if such usage is detected.

Character properties are detailed by the Unicode Regular Expressions [\[UnicodeRegex\]](29.-references.md).
