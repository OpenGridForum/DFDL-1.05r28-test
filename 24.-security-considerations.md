# 24. Security Considerations

All locations MUST be properly initialized before writing to prevent accidental \(or purposeful\) transmission of data in the unused parts of data formats. Even when a DFDL description does not specify that data must be written to a particular part of the output representation, a defined pattern MUST always be written.

When unparsing data it is a Schema Definition Error if the representation properties that control filling and padding are not defined by the DFDL schema. The DFDL processor MUST fail if they are not defined so that it is certain no region of the output data has unspecified contents.

If regions within a DFDL-described data object are encrypted, then when decrypting them proper means MUST be used to assure secure passage of passwords to the decrypting software. Such means are beyond the scope of the DFDL language specification.

In addition, if encryption passwords/keys are stored in DFDL schema-described data, then proper means MUST be used to assure that the decrypted form of these passwords is not revealed. Such means are beyond the scope of the DFDL language specification.
