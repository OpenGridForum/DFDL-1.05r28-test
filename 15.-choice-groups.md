# 15. Choice Groups

A choice corresponds to concepts called variant records, multi-format records, discriminated unions, or tagged unions in various programming languages. In some contexts, choices are referred to generally as 'unions'. However, this should not be confused with XSD unions.

The following properties are specific to xs:choice.

Table 51 Properties for Choice Groups

A choice can have a dfdl: initiator and/or a dfdl:terminator as described earlier.

We will use this terminology:

_**Branch**_ - A _branch_ is one of the available alternatives within a choice. A branch can be an element of simple type or complex type, or it can be an embedded sequence, choice or group reference.

_**Root of the Branch**_ - Each branch conceptually has a single schema component at its root which is an element, sequence, choice or group reference. This component is known as the Root of the Branch

The Root of the Branch must not be optional. That is XSD minOccurs must be greater than zero.

A choice that declares no branches in the DFDL schema is a Schema Definition Error.

When processing a choice group, the parser validates any contained path expressions. If a path expression contained inside a choice branch refers to any other branch of the choice, then it is a Schema Definition Error. Note that this rule handles nested choices also. A path that navigates outward from an inner choice to another alternative of an outer choice is violating this rule with respect to the outer choice.

## 15.1 Resolving Choices

When processing a choice, there are two ways to resolve the intended branch. In one, speculative parsing is used. In the other, a constant-time direct dispatch to a branch is performed.

### 15.1.1 Resolving Choices via Speculation

Speculative resolution works as follows:

1. Attempt to parse the first branch of the choice.
2. If this fails with a processing error

   a\) If a dfdl:discriminator evaluated to true earlier on this branch  
   then the parser is 'bound' to this branch and parsing of the entire choice construct fails with a processing error.

   b\) If the branch has a dfdl:initiator and the choice has dfdl:initiatedContent ‘yes’  
   then the parser is 'bound' to this branch and parsing of the entire choice construct fails with a processing error.

   c\) Otherwise we repeat from step 1 for the next branch of the choice.

3. It is a processing error if the branches of the choice are exhausted.
4. If a branch is successfully parsed without error, then that branch's Infoset becomes the Infoset for the parse of the choice construct.
5. If the branch is an element declaration having dfdl:occursCountKind='expression' or dfdl:occursCountKind='parsed', then zero instances are possible. If the branch parses successfully without a discriminator but produces no element occurrences, then the branch is considered missing, and the parser looks for the next branch

It is not possible for variable settings to be communicated from the speculative attempt to parse a branch to any other parsing situation. The speculative effort is completely isolated. Whether it succeeds or fails, neither the parse position in the source data, nor anything in the variable memory, nor the Infoset is affected.

Nested choices can require unbounded\[46\] look ahead into the data.

\[46\] Because DFDL v1.0 does not allow recursive definitions, the notion of unbounded here is limited by the depth of the DFDL schema, so is not truly unbounded as it would be if recursion were allowed.

### 15.1.2 Resolving Choices via Direct Dispatch

Direct dispatch provides a constant-time dispatch to a choice branch independent of how many choice branches there are.

Direct dispatch is indicated by the dfdl:choiceDispatchKey property. This expression is evaluated to compute the string matching \(case sensitive\) one of the dfdl:choiceBranchKey property values of one of the choice branches.

When a match is found, it is as if a dfdl:discriminator had evaluated to true on that branch. It is selected as resolution of the choice, and there is no backtracking to try other alternative selections if a processing error occurs.

The dfdl:choiceBranchKey property can be placed on element references, local element declarations, local sequences, local choices, or group references. All values of dfdl:choiceBranchKey properties must be unique across all branches of a choice that carries a dfdl:choiceDispatchKey property and it is a Schema Definition Error otherwise.

Note that it is a Schema Definition Error if both dfdl:initiatedContent and dfdl:choiceDispatchKey are provided on the same choice. However, it is not an error if a discriminator exists on a choice branch along with a dfdl:choiceBranchKey.

### 15.1.3 Unparsing Choices

On unparsing there is the question of how one identifies the appropriate schema choice branch corresponding to the data in the Infoset. This is complicated by the fact that the children may not be elements. They may themselves be sequences or choices. The selection of the choice branch is as follows: The element in the Infoset is used to search the choice branches in the schema, in schema definition order, but without looking inside any complex elements. If the element occurs in a branch, then that branch is selected and if subsequently a processing error occurs, this selection is not revisited \(that is, there is no backtracking\). If the next element to unparse does not identify any branch of the choice, or there is no next element to unparse, then there must be a choice branch with no required elements and the first such branch would be selected for unparsing. A choice branch could consist only of a nest of model groups with no actual element content or only optional element content.

To avoid any unintended behavior, all the children of a choice can be modeled as elements.

#### 15.1.3.1 Unparsing Choices in Hidden Groups

When a choice appears inside a hidden group, there will be no corresponding Infoset elements as there are none for hidden groups. The first branch of the choice is unparsed. All elements contained in the branch must have default values or must have dfdl:outputValueCalc properties to compute their values, and it is a Schema Definition Error otherwise.
