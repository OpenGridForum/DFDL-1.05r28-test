# 3. Notational and Definitional Conventions

Examples of DFDL schemas provided herin are for illustration purposes only and for clarity they will often not include all the necessary DFDL properties that would be needed for a complete functional DFDL schema.

## 3.1 Glossary and Terminology

This specification provides definitions of the terms it uses at the point of first use. However, as this specification will not generally be read linearly, but out of order, a complete glossary is provided in Appendix E: Glossary of Terms.

The capitalized key words MUST, MUST NOT, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MAY, REQUIRED, OPTIONAL, and RECOMMENDED in this document are to be interpreted as described in [\[RFC2119\]](29.-references.md). Such usage in capital letters is generally about DFDL implementations and their common or distinguishing characteristics.

When describing requirements for correct usage of the DFDL language by a DFDL Schema author, these same words are used, but are not capitalized. For example, we may say "The DFDL fillByte property _must_ be a single byte or single character." What is intended by "_must_" here is that if the value for that property does not conform, that it is a Schema Definition Error by the schema author.

Similarly, when describing characteristics of data being parsed or being unparsed, and whether that data conforms to the format described by a DFDL schema, these same words may be used. For example, we may say "The representation _must_ be followed by a terminating delimiter.", but what is intended by "_must_" in this case is that the consequence of the data not having that terminating delimiter is a Processing Error because the data does not comply with its format specification.

When describing data, the uncapitalized terms _required_ and _optional_ in this document have specific formal meanings having to do with the way element declarations are annotated in the DFDL language.The data corresponding to such an element declaration is said to be either required or optional, and the DFDL element declaration is said to be for a required element, or an optional element.

## 3.2 Failure Types

Where the phrase "MUST be consistent with" is used, it is assumed that a conforming DFDL implementation MUST check for the consistency and issue appropriate diagnostic messages when an inconsistency is found.

There are several kinds of failures that can occur when a DFDL processor is handling data and/or a DFDL schema. These are:

* _**Schema Definition Error**_ or _**SDE**_ for short - these indicate the DFDL schema is not meaningful. They are generally fatal errors that prevent or stop processing of data.
* _**Processing Error**_ - These are errors that occur when parsing, in which case they are called Parse Errors, or when unparsing in which case they are called Unparse Errors.
  * _**Parse Error**_ - these errors can cause the parser to search \(such as via backtracking\) for alternative ways to parse the data as are allowed by the DFDL schema. In that sense parse-time processing errors guide the parsing, and when the parser finds an alternative way to parse the data, a prior parse error is said to have been _suppressed_. A parse error that is not suppressed MUST terminate parsing with a diagnostic message.
  * _**Unparse Error**_ - these errors are generally fatal. They MUST cause unparsing to stop with a diagnostic message.
* _**Validation Error**_ - These are errors when optional validation checking is available and enabled. Validation errors MUST not stop, nor influence, parsing or unparsing behavior. Validation errors are effectively warnings indicating lack of conformance of the parser output, or the unparser input, with the XML Schema facet constraints, or the XSD maxOccurs and XSD minOccurs values.
* _**Recoverable Error**_ - In addition to using XML Schema validation, DFDL also provides the ability to add recoverable error assertions to a DFDL schema. These cause diagnostic messages to be created but MUST not influence parsing or unparsing.
