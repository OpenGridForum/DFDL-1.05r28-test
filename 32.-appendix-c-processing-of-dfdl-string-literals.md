# 32. Appendix C: Processing of DFDL String literals

A DFDL String Literal describes characters or bytes that can appear in the data. The syntax of a DFDL String Literal is described in Section 6.3. This appendix describes how a DFDL String Literal MUST be processed by a DFDL processor.

## 32.1 Interpreting a DFDL String Literal

A DFDL String literal is a sequence of one or more _string literal parts_. Each string literal part describes zero or more characters or exactly one byte. To process a DFDL string literal correctly it is necessary to parse it into its string literal parts using the grammar in Table 3 DFDL Character Entity, Character Class Entity, and Byte Value Entity Syntax of Section 6.3.1 DFDL String Literals.

## 32.2 Recognizing a DFDL String Literal

When parsing, a DFDL processor MUST be able to recognize a DFDL String Literal in the data. The recognition algorithm is used whenever the DFDL processor needs to process a property of type 'DFDL String Literal'.

The recognition algorithm is as follows:

`for each DfdlStringLiteralPart  
 if this DfdlStringLiteralPart is found in the data at the current offset  
 advance the offset by the width of the characters matched  
 else  
 return false  
 end if  
return true`

## 32.3 Recognizing DFDL String Literal Part

Each type of string literal part and/or the DfdlESEntity is recognised as described in the table below:

      <td style="text-align:left">LiteralString</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>The literal string is specifying a sequence of Unicode characters. The
          string part is recognized if the same Unicode characters are found in the
          data at the current offset.</p>
        <p>Implementation note: It is not necessary for either the LiteralString
          or the data to be encoded using a Unicode encoding. The matching algorithm
          MUST operate as if the LiteralString and the data were both converted to
          Unicode before comparison.</p>

      <td style="text-align:left">

        <p>The string part is recognized if the literal byte in the data at the current
          byte offset matches the raw byte value.</p>
        <p>This entity is specifying a raw byte value and not a character. It will
          not always be safe to interpret the byte value as a character in the component&apos;s
          encoding.</p>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">DfdlNLEntity</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>The entity is specifying a newline character or character sequence.</p>
        <p>The string part is recognized if a newline character sequence is found
          in the data at the current byte offset:</p>
        <p>The newline character sequences are defined in Table 5 DFDL Character
          Class Entities, in Section 6.3.1.2 DFDL Character Entities, Character Class
          Entities, and Byte Values in String Literals.</p>
        <p>The recognition algorithm MUST be greedy. If the CR character is matched
          then the DFDL processor MUST check to see whether it is followed by an
          LF character and if so, consume that character also.</p>

          in Table 5 DFDL Character Class Entities, in Section 6.3.1.2 DFDL Character
          Entities, Character Class Entities, and Byte Values in String Literals.</p>
