# 35. Appendix F: Specific Errors Classified

This section clarifies which errors are Schema Definition Errors and which are processing errors.

The following are processing errors:

* Arithmetic Errors
  * Division by zero
  * Integer Arithmetic Underflow
  * Integer Arithmetic Overflow
  * Note: Floating point math can produce NaN \(Not a Number\) values. This is not an error, nor are properly typed operations on floating point NaN values.
* Expression Errors
  * Dynamic Type Error – unable to convert expression result value to target type
    * Example: non-digits found in string argument to xs:int\(…\) constructor.
    * Note: if a DFDL Implementation cannot distinguish Dynamic Type Errors from Static Type Errors, then a Dynamic Type Error MUST cause a Schema Definition Error
  * Index out of bounds error – index exceeds the number of occurrences or is less than 1.
    * Note: same error for dfdl:testBit if bitPos is not 1..8, or for character positions in a string-value
  * Indexing of non-array non-optional element
    * Example: x\[1\] when x is declared and has both XSD minOccurs="1" and XSD maxOccurs="1" explicitly, or by not stating either or both of them.
  * Illegal argument value \(correct type, illegal value\)
* Parse Errors
  * Delimiter not found
  * Data from the data stream is not convertible to element type
  * Assertion failed
  * Discriminator failed
  * Required occurrence not found
  * All choice alternatives fail to parse
  * Character set decoding failure and dfdl:encodingErrorPolicy is 'error'
* Unparse Errors
  * Truncation scenarios where truncation is being disallowed
  * Rounding error – rounding needed but not allowed. \(Unparsing\)
  * No choice alternative matching the Infoset can be identified for unparsing. Character set encoding failure and dfdl:encodingErrorPolicy is 'error'
* Implementation-defined Limit Errors - Implementations can have fixed or adjustable limits that some formats and some data may exceed at processing time. This specification does not further specify what these errors are, but some possible examples are:
  * Data longer than allowed for representation of a given data type
    * Example: exceed maximum length of representation of xs:decimal when dfdl:representation is "text".
  * Expression references too far back into Infoset \(parsing\)
  * Expression references too far forward into Infoset \(unparsing\)
  * Number of array elements exceeds limit.
  * Regular expression exceeds time limit

The following are Schema Definition Errors, regardless of whether they are detected in advance of processing or once processing begins:

* Errors in XML Schema Construction and Structure
  * See XML Schema Specification Part 1, Section 5.1 \[[XSDLV1]()\]
* Use of XSD constructs outside of DFDL subset
* Implementation-defined Limitations
  * Use of DFDL schema constructs not supported by this implementation.
    * Example: xs:choice is an optional part of the DFDL specification \(see section 21\). If not supported, it MUST be rejected as a Schema Definition Error.
    * Example: use of packed-decimal when it is not supported by the implementation.
    * Example: use of dfdl:assert when it is not supported by the implementation \(See Spec section 21 on DFDL Subsets\)
    * Note: Unrecognized DFDL properties or property values can produce a warning and an implementation can attempt to process data despite the warning.
  * Exceeding implementation-dependent limits for schema size/complexity
    * Example: schema too large – simply a limit on how large the schema can be, how many files, how many top-level constructs, etc.
* Schema Not Valid
  * See XML Schema Specification Part 1, Section 5.2 \[[XSDLV1]()\]
* UPA violation \(Unique Particle Attribution\)
* Reference to DFDL global definition not found
  * Format definition \(dfdl:defineFormat\)
  * Escape schema definition \(dfdl:defineEscapeScheme\)
  * Variable Definition \(dfdl:defineVariable\)
* DFDL Annotations not well-formed or not valid
* DFDL Annotations Incompatible
  * E.g., dfdl:assert and dfdl:discriminator at same combined annotation point, or more than one format annotation at an annotation point.
* DFDL Properties and their values
  * Property not applicable to DFDL annotation
  * Property value not suitable for property
  * Property conflict
    * Between Element Reference and Element Declaration
    * Between Element Declaration and Simple Type Definition
    * Between Simple Type Definition and Base Simple Type Definition
    * Between Group Reference and Sequence/Choice of Group Definition
  * Required property not found
* Expressions
  * Expression syntax error
  * Named child element doesn't exist – E.g., /a/b, and there is no child b in existence.
    * Note: no child possible in the schema is a different error, but also a Schema Definition Error, as /a/b would not have a type in that case.
    * Note: This is a Schema Definition Error, as schema authors are advised to use fn:exists\(…\) to test for existence of elements when it is possible that they not exist.
  * Variable read but not defined
  * Variable assigned after read
  * Variable assigned more than once
  * Static Type error – type is incorrect for usage
    * Note: if an implementation is unable to distinguish Static Type Errors from Dynamic Type Errors, then both MUST cause Schema Definition Errors.
  * Path step definition not found – e.g., /a/n:b but no definition for n:b as local or global element.
  * Not enough arguments for function
  * Expression value is not single node
    * Most DFDL expression contexts require an expression to identify a single node, not an array \(aka sequence of nodes\). There are a few exceptions such as the fn:count\(…\) function, where the path expression must be to an array or optional element.
  * Expression value is not array element or optional element.
    * Some DFDL expression contexts require an array or an optional element.
    * Example: The fn:count\(...\) function argument must be to an array or optional element. It is a Schema Definition Error if the argument expression is otherwise.
* Regular Expressions
  * Syntax error
