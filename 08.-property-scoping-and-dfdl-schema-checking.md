# 8. Property Scoping and DFDL Schema Checking

## 8.1 Property Scoping

### 8.1.1 Property Scoping Rules

This section describes the rules that govern the scope over which DFDL representation properties apply

The scope of the representational properties on each of the component format annotations is given in Table 10 DFDL annotation scoping

| **Annotation Point** | **Property Scope** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Schema declaration | dfdl:format representation properties apply lexically as default properties over all components in the schema |
| Element declaration | dfdl:element properties apply locally |
| Element reference | dfdl:element properties apply locally |
| Simple type definition | dfdl:simpleType properties apply locally |
| Sequence | dfdl:sequence properties apply locally |
| Choice | dfdl:choice properties apply locally |
| Group reference | dfdl:group properties apply locally |

**Table 10 DFDL annotation scoping**

Note: This table lists DFDL annotations on schema components. DFDL annotations can also be placed on other DFDL annotations, such as a dfdl:format within a dfdl:defineFormat, to provide a named reusable format definition. In this case the annotation applies only where the named format is referenced.

DFDL representation properties explicitly defined on annotations, other than a dfdl:format on an xs:schema declaration, apply locally to that component only. The explicitly defined properties are the combination of any defined locally on the annotation and any defined on the dfdl:defineFormat annotation referenced by a local dfdl:ref property. When a property is defined both locally and on the dfdl:defineFormat, the locally defined property takes precedence.

The dfdl:format annotation on the top level xs:schema declaration provides defaults for the DFDL representation properties at every DFDL-annotatable component contained in the schema document. They do not apply to any components in any included or imported schema document \(these may have their own defaults\).

### 8.1.2 Providing Defaults for DFDL properties

A dfdl:format annotation on the top level xs:schema declaration may provide defaults for some or all the DFDL representation properties at every annotation point within the schema document. The default properties may be specified in attribute or element form. \(Short form is not allowed on the xs:schema element.\)

The dfdl:ref property is not a representation property so no default can be set.

The dfdl:escapeSchemeRef property provides a default reference to a dfdl:defineEscapeScheme, the properties of dfdl:escapeScheme are not defaulted individually.

DFDL representation properties defined explicitly on a component apply only to that component and override the default value of that property provided by a default format specified by an xs:schema dfdl:format annotation.

The example below demonstrates the overriding of the encoding property. The value 'ASCII' is the default value for the title element, but then it is overridden by the locally defined utf-8 value for the encoding property, which takes precedence.

`<xs:schema>  
  <xs:annotation>  
    <xs:appinfo source="http://www.ogf.org/dfdl/">`  
      `<dfdl:format` **`encoding="ASCII"`** `/>`  
    `</xs:appinfo>  
  </xs:annotation>  
  
 <xs:element name="book">  
  <xs:complexType>`

 ****   `<xs:sequence>  
      <xs:element name="title" type="xs:string">  
        <xs:annotation>  
          <xs:appinfo source="http://www.ogf.org/dfdl/">`  
            `<dfdl:element` **`encoding="utf-8"`** `/>`  
          `</xs:appinfo>  
        </xs:annotation>  
      </xs:element>  
      <xs:element name="pages" type="xs:int"/>  
    </xs:sequence>  
  </xs:complexType>  
 </xs:element>  
</xs:schema>`

### 8.1.3 Combining DFDL Representation Properties from a dfdl:defineFormat

The DFDL representation properties contained in a referenced dfdl:defineFormat are combined with any DFDL representation properties defined locally on a construct as if they had been defined locally. If the same property is defined locally in and in the referenced dfdl:defineFormat then the local property takes precedence. The combined set of explicit DFDL properties has precedence over any defaults set by a dfdl:format on the xs:schema.

`<xs:schema>  
  <xs:annotation>  
    <xs:appinfo source="http://www.ogf.org/dfdl/">  
      <dfdl:defineFormat name='myFormat'>  
 <dfdl:format encoding="ASCII" />  
 </dfdl:defineFormat>  
    </xs:appinfo>  
  </xs:annotation>  
  
 <xs:element name="book">  
  <xs:complexType>`  
 **``**   `<xs:sequence>  
      <xs:element name="title" type="xs:string">  
        <xs:annotation>  
          <xs:appinfo source="http://www.ogf.org/dfdl/">`  
            `<dfdl:element` **`ref='myFormat' encoding="UTF-8"`** `/>`  
          `</xs:appinfo>  
        </xs:annotation>  
      </xs:element>  
      <xs:element name="pages" type="xs:int"/>  
    </xs:sequence>  
  </xs:complexType>  
 </xs:element>  
</xs:schema>`

The example above demonstrates the overriding of an encoding property. The 'ASCII' format encoding from the 'myFormat' is overridden by the UTF-8 format encoding, which as a locally defined property takes precedence.

### 8.1.4 Combining DFDL Properties from References

The DFDL properties from the following types of reference are combined using the rules below:

1. An xs:element and its referenced xs:simpleType restriction,
2. An xs:element reference and its referenced global xs:element
3. An xs:group reference and an xs:sequence or xs:choice in its referenced global xs:group
4. An xs:simpleType restriction and its base xs:simpleType restriction

Rules

1. Create \(1\) an empty working set of "explicit" properties, and \(2\) create an empty working set of "default" properties.
2. Move to the innermost schema component in the chain of references.
3. Assemble its applicable "explicit" properties from its local dfdl:ref \(if present\) and its local properties \(if present\), the latter overriding the former \(that is, local wins over referenced\).
4. Combine these with the current working set of "explicit" properties. It is a Schema Definition Error if the same property appears twice. The result is a new working set of "explicit" properties.
5. Obtain applicable "default" properties from a dfdl:format annotation on the xs:schema that contains the component \(if such annotation is present\). Combine these with the current working set of "default" properties, the latter overriding the former \(that is, inner wins\). Result is a new working set of "default" properties.
6. Move to the schema component that references the current component and repeat starting at step 3. If there is no referencing component, carry out step 5 and then go to step 7.
7. Combine the resultant sets of properties. The "explicit" properties take priority, "defaults" only used when no "explicit" property is present. It is a Schema Definition Error if a required property is in neither the "explicit" nor the "default" working sets.

The "Applicable" properties are all the DFDL properties that apply to that schema component. For example, all the DFDL properties that apply to a particular xs:simpleType \(as defined by section 13\).

`<xs:simpleType name="newType">  
 <xs:annotation>  
 <xs:appinfo source="http://www.ogf.org/dfdl/">`  
 **`<dfdl:simpleType alignment="16"/>`**  
 `</xs:appinfo>  
 </xs:annotation>  
 <xs:restriction base="xs:integer">  
 <xs:maxInclusive value="10"/>  
 </xs:restriction>  
</xs:simpleType>  
<xs:element name="testElement1" type="newType">  
 <xs:annotation>  
 <xs:appinfo source="http://www.ogf.org/dfdl/">`  
 `<dfdl:element` **`representation="binary"`**`/>`  
 `</xs:appinfo>  
 </xs:annotation>  
</xs:element>`

The locally defined dfdl:alignment property with value '16' from the xs:simpleType 'newType' is combined with the locally defined dfdl:representation property with value 'binary' and applied to element 'testElement1',

`<xs:simpleType name="otherNewType">  
 <xs:annotation>  
 <xs:appinfo source="http://www.ogf.org/dfdl/">`  
 `<dfdl:simpleType` **`alignment="64"`**`/>`  
 `</xs:appinfo>  
 </xs:annotation>  
 <xs:restriction base="newType">  
 <xs:maxInclusive value="5"/>  
 </xs:restriction>  
</xs:simpleType>  
<xs:simpleType name="newType">  
 <xs:annotation>  
 <xs:appinfo source="http://www.ogf.org/dfdl/">`  
 `<dfdl:simpleType` **`representation='binary`**`'/>`  
 `</xs:appinfo>  
 </xs:annotation>  
 <xs:restriction base="xs:int">  
 <xs:maxInclusive value="10"/>  
 </xs:restriction>  
</xs:simpleType>`

The locally defined dfdl:representation property with value 'binary' is combined with the locally defined dfdl:alignment property with value '64' from the xs:simpleType restriction 'otherNewType'.

`<xs:sequence>  
 <xs:element ref="testElement1`**`"`**`>  
 <xs:annotation>  
 <xs:appinfo source="http://www.ogf.org/dfdl/">`  
 `<dfdl:element` **`binaryNumberRep ="binary"`**`/>`  
 `</xs:appinfo>  
 </xs:annotation>  
 </xs:element>  
</xs:sequence>  
<xs:element name="testElement1" type="newType">  
 <xs:annotation>  
 <xs:appinfo source="http://www.ogf.org/dfdl/">`  
 `<dfdl:element` **`representation="binary"`**`/>`  
 `</xs:appinfo>  
 </xs:annotation>  
</xs:element>  
<xs:simpleType name="newType">  
 <xs:annotation>  
 <xs:appinfo source="http://www.ogf.org/dfdl/">`  
 `<dfdl:simpleType` **`alignment="16"`**`/>`  
 `</xs:appinfo>  
 </xs:annotation>  
 <xs:restriction base="xs:int">  
 <xs:maxInclusive value="10"/>  
 </xs:restriction>  
</xs:simpleType>`

The locally defined dfdl:alignment property with value '16' from the xs:simpleType 'newType' is combined with the locally defined dfdl:representation property with value 'binary' and locally defined dfdl:binaryNumberRep with a value of 'binary'

`<!-- SCHEMA1 -->  
<xs:schema targetNamespace="" xmlns:tns1="http://tns1">  
 <xs:annotation>  
 <xs:appinfo source="http://www.ogf.org/dfdl/">`  
 `<dfdl:format`**`encoding="ASCII" byteOrder="littleEndian"`**  
                               **`initiator="" terminator=""`**  
                               **`sequenceKind="ordered"`** `/>`  
    `</xs:appinfo>  
  </xs:annotation>`  
 `<xsd:import namespace="http://tns2" schemaLocation="SCHEMA2.xsd"/>`  
  
 `<xs:element name="book">  
  <xs:complexType>`  
 `<xs:group ref="tns2:ggrp1"` **`dfdl:separator=","`**`></xs:group>`  
  `</xs:complexType>  
 </xs:element>  
</xs:schema>`

`<!-- SCHEMA2 -->  
<xs:schema targetNamespace="" xmlns:tns2="http://tns2">  
  <xs:annotation>  
    <xs:appinfo source="http://www.ogf.org/dfdl/">`  
      `<dfdl:format encoding="UTF-8"`**`byteOrder="littleEndian"`  
                                `initiator=""`**  
                                **`sequenceKind="ordered"`** `/>`  
    `</xs:appinfo>  
  </xs:annotation>  
  
 <xs:group name="ggrp1" >`   
 `<xs:sequence` **`dfdl:separatorPosition="infix"`** `>`  
 `<xs:element name="customer" type="xs:string"`  
 ``**`dfdl:length="8" dfdl:lengthKind="explicit"`** `/>`  
 `</xs:sequence>  
 </xs:group>  
</xs:schema>`

The DFDL properties applied to the xs:sequence in xs:group "ggrp1" in SCHEMA2 when referenced from the group reference in SCHEMA1 are

1. dfdl:separator "," from the group reference in SCHEMA1
2. dfdl:separatorPosition "infix" from the group declaration in SCHEMA2
3. dfdl:encoding "UTF-8", dfdl:initiator ''" from the default dfdl:format annotation in SCHEMA2
4. dfdl:terminator "" from the default dfdl:format annotation in SCHEMA1

## 8.2 DFDL Schema Checking

When the DFDL schema itself contains an error, it implies that the DFDL processor cannot process data because the DFDL schema is not meaningful. All conforming DFDL processors MUST detect all Schema Definition Errors and MUST issue an appropriate diagnostic message. The behavior of a DFDL processor after a Schema Definition Error is detected is out of scope for this specification.

When a Schema definition error can be detected _statically_, that is given only the schema, it is desirable, though not required by the DFDL standard, that diagnostic messages SHOULD be issued before any data are processed. However, because some representation properties may obtain their values from the data, not all Schema Definition Errors can be detected without reference to data so some Schema Definition Error diagnostics MAY be issued once data is being processed.

The expression language included within DFDL is strongly, statically type checkable. This means that type checking of expressions MAY be performed statically, that is, without processing data, and implementations are encouraged to perform this checking statically so that _Static Type Errors_ \(Schema Definition Errors having to do with type inconsistencies\) can be detected before processing data.

### 8.2.1 Schema Component Constraint: Unique Particle Attribution

The term _particle_ is used in XSD to refer to a schema component that can have dimension \(XSD minOccurs and/or XSD maxOccurs\) expressed on it. In DFDL only local element declarations and element references are particles.

A DFDL processor MUST implement the Schema Component Constraint: Unique Particle Attribution defined in XML Schema Part 1: Structures \[[XSDLV1]()\] that applies to the DFDL schema subset.

Two elements **overlap** if

* They are both element declaration particles whose declarations have the same name and target namespace.

A schema will violate the unique attribution constraint if it contains two particles which overlap and which either

* are both in the particles of a choice group.

or

1. either describes adjacent information items in an xs:sequence and the first has XSD minOccurs less than XSD maxOccurs.

### 8.2.2 Optional Checks and Warnings

* A DFDL processor that only implements a DFDL parser does not have to perform Schema Definition Error checking for properties that are solely used when unparsing, though it is recommended that it does so for portability reasons.
* A DFDL processor that does not implement some optional features does not have to check properties or annotations required by those optional features but MUST issue a warning that an unrecognized property or annotation has been encountered.
* A DFDL processor MUST NOT check global element declarations nor type or group definitions as they may legitimately be incomplete due to properties intended to be supplied based on scoping rules and the context at the point of use. There are two exceptions to this, which MUST be checked:
  1. Global simple type definitions that are referenced by the dfdl:prefixLengthType property
  2. Global element declarations that are the document root.

Some situations suggest likely errors, but a DFDL processor cannot be certain. In these situations, a DFDL processor MAY issue warnings to assist a DFDL schema author in identifying likely errors. An important case of this is when the DFDL processor encounters a schema component and annotation where there are explicitly properties that are not relevant to the component as defined. Depending on the specifics of the component and property the DFDL processor MUST take certain actions. If the:

* Property is not applicable to the component's DFDL annotation.
  * Schema definition error. Example is lengthKind on xs:sequence.

However, for these situations, the DFDL processor MAY take certain actions:

* Property is not applicable because of simple type.
  * Warning \(optional\). Example is calendarPatternKind on xs:string.
* Property is not applicable because of another DFDL property setting.
  * Warning \(optional\). Example is binaryNumberRep when representation is text.
* Invalid value for a property that is unused or ignored.
  * Warning \(optional\). Example is dfdl:lengthKind is not ‘explicit’ but dfdl:length is an expression and that expression contains invalid syntax.
