        <p>This property can be computed by way of an expression which returns the
          string &apos;bigEndian&apos; or &apos;littleEndian&apos;. The expression
          must not contain forward references to elements which have not yet been

        <p>This property applies to all Number, Calendar (date and time), and Boolean
          types with representation binary. Specifically, that is binary integers,
          binary booleans, all packed decimals, binary floats, binary seconds and
          binary milliseconds.</p>
        <p>This property is never used to establish the byte order for text /strings,
          as each character set encoding involving multiple bytes of data per code

        <p>Valid values &apos;mostSignificantBitFirst&apos;, &apos;leastSignificantBitFirst&apos;.</p>
        <p>The bits of a byte each have a place value or significance of , for <em>n</em> from
          0 to 7. Hence, the byte value . A bit can always be unambiguously identified
          as the 2<em>n</em>-bit.</p>
        <p>The bit order is the correspondence of a bit&apos;s numeric significance
          to the bit position (1 to 8) within the byte.</p>
        <p>Value &apos;mostSignificantBitFirst&apos; means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The bit is first, i.e., has bit position 1.</li>
          <li>In general, the bit has position 8 - <em>n.</em>
          </li>
          <li>The least significant bits of byte N are considered to be adjacent to
            the most significant bits of byte N+1.</li>

        <p>Value &apos;leastSignificantBitFirst&apos; means:</p>

        </ul>
        <p>This property applies to all content and framing since it determines which
          bits of a byte occupy what bit positions. Content and framing are defined
          in terms of regions of the data stream, and these regions are defined in
          terms of the starting bit position and ending bit position; hence, dfdl:bitOrder
          is relevant to determining the specific bits of any grammar region (see
          Section 9.3 DFDL Data Syntax Grammar) when the region&apos;s starting bit
          position or ending bit position are not on a byte boundary.</p>
        <p>The bit order can only change on byte boundaries, and alignment of up
          to 7 bits will be skipped (parsing) or inserted (unparsing) to ensure byte-alignment
          whenever the bit order changes.</p>

        <p>Conforming DFDL v1.0 processors MUST accept at least &apos;UTF-8&apos;,

\[27\] The concept of native-endian is avoided in DFDL since a DFDL schema containing such a property binding would not contain a complete description of data, but rather an incomplete one which would behave differently based on characteristics of the machine and implementation where the DFDL processor is executed. In DFDL this same behavior is achieved through the use of explicit parameterization using DFDL variables to set dfdl:byteOrder. See Section 7.7.1.2 Predefined Variables.

## 11.1 Unicode Byte Order Mark \(BOM\)

DFDL does not provide any special treatment of Unicode Byte-Order Marks. They are treated as a Unicode ZWNBS character.

## 11.2 Character Encoding and Decoding Errors

When parsing, these are the errors that can occur when decoding characters into Unicode/ISO 10646.

1. The data is broken - invalid bit/byte sequences are found which do not match the definition of a character for the encoding.
2. Not enough data is found to make up the entire encoding of a character. That is, a fragment of a valid encoding is found.

When unparsing, these are the errors that can occur when encoding characters from Unicode/ISO 10646 into the specified encoding.

1. No mapping provided by the encoding specification.
2. Not enough room to output the entire encoding of the character \(e.g., need 3 bytes for a character encoding that uses 3-bytes for that character, but only 1 byte remains in the available length.

The subsections below describe how these errors are handled.

### 11.2.1 Property dfdl:encodingErrorPolicy

The property dfdl:encodingErrorPolicy has two possible values: 'error' and 'replace'.

#### 11.2.1.1 dfdl:encodingErrorPolicy 'error'

If 'error', then any error when decoding characters while parsing causes a processing error. For unparsing, any error when encoding characters causes a processing error.

When parsing, it does not matter if this happens when scanning for delimiters, matching a regular expression, matching a literal nil value, or constructing the value of a textual element.

There is one exception. When dfdl:lengthUnits is 'bytes', the 'not enough data' decoding error is ignored, and the data making up the fragment character is skipped over. Symmetrically, when unparsing the 'not enough room' encoding error is ignored and the left-over bytes are filled with the dfdl:fillByte.

Detection of character set decoding errors is often implementation-dependent because DFDL Implementations are free to optimize processing speed by skipping character decoding or encoding whenever possible. For example: when character set encodings are fixed-width, it is possible to determine lengths in bytes or bits from the length in characters by multiplying the length value by the character width, without having to decode any characters.

When parsing, character decoding errors MUST be detected when

1. the decoding results in a character being placed into the DFDL Infoset
2. the decoding is necessary to identify a delimiter
3. the decoding is necessary to determine a match or non-match of a regular expression in a dfdl:assert or dfdl:discriminator with testKind=’pattern’.

When unparsing, character encoding errors MUST be detected when

1. an unmapped character appears in the Infoset value of an element.

In all other cases, character set decoding and encoding errors MAY not be detected.

#### 11.2.1.2 dfdl:encodingErrorPolicy 'replace' for parsing

If 'replace' then any error when decoding characters results in the insertion of the Unicode Replacement Character \(U+FFFD\) as the replacement for that error.

It does not matter if this error and replacement happens when scanning for delimiters, matching a regular expression, matching a literal nil value, or constructing the value of a textual element.

There is one exception. When dfdl:lengthUnits is 'bytes', the 'not enough data' decoding error is ignored, no replacement character is created. The data making up the fragment character is skipped over. \(It will be filled with the dfdl:fillByte when unparsing.\)

Note that the "." wildcard in regular expressions will match the Unicode Replacement Character, so ".\*" and ".+" regular expressions can potentially cause very large matches \(up to the entire data stream\) to occur when data contains errors and dfdl:encodingErrorPolicy 'replace'. DFDL Schema authors are advised that bounded length negated regular expressions can help in this case. E.g., "\[^\uFFFD\]{0,50}" says to match any character \(excluding the Unicode Replacement Character\), but only up to length 50.

It is also worth noting that the Unicode Replacement Character can appear in data as an ordinary character, and this cannot be distinguished from the insertion of the Unicode Replacement Character due to a decoding error. This is likely to happen for data that is \(a\) initially parsed by a DFDL parser with dfdl:encodingErrorPolicy 'replace', and \(b\) which contains some decoding errors, but \(c\) is nevertheless successfully parsed, \(d\) is written back out to a file or other data repository, and \(e\) is parsed again. The written data will have replaced data errors with the Unicode Replacement Character, and so if the data is parsed again, it will no longer have errors, but will have the Unicode Replacement Character as a regular character in the data.

If dfdl:lengthUnits is 'characters', then a Unicode Replacement Character counts as contributing a single character to the length.

If the data contains more than one adjacent decode error, then the specific number of Unicode Replacement Characters that are inserted as the replacement of these errors is implementation- dependent. That is, some implementations MAY view, for example, three consecutive erroneous bytes as three separate decode errors, others MAY view them as a single or two decode errors. All implementations MUST, however, insert some number of Unicode Replacement Characters, and then continue to decode characters following the erroneous data.

The trimming of pad characters always happens after Unicode Replacement Characters have been inserted into the data.

#### 11.2.1.3 dfdl:encodingErrorPolicy 'replace' for unparsing

For unparsing, each encoding has a replacement/substitution character specified by the ICU. This character is substituted for the unmapped character or the character that has too large an encoding to fit in the available space. 

There is one exception. When dfdl:lengthUnits is 'bytes', the 'not enough room' encoding error is ignored. The left-over bytes are filled with the dfdl:fillByte \(they are skipped when parsing.\)

The definitions of these substitution characters can be conveniently found for many encodings in the ICU Converter Explorer \([http://demo.icu-project.org/icu-bin/convexp](http://demo.icu-project.org/icu-bin/convexp)\). 

An encoding error is a processing error if the encoding does not provide a substitution/replacement character definition. \(This would be rare but could occur if a DFDL implementation allows many encodings beyond the minimum set.\)

### 11.2.2 Unicode UTF-16 Decoding/Encoding Non-Errors

The following specific situations involving encodings UTF-16, UTF-16LE, and UTF-16BE when dfdl:utf16Width "fixed", and they do not cause a decoding or encoding error.

* unpaired surrogate codepoint
* out-of-order surrogate codepoint pair
* surrogate codepoint pair is encountered

In all these cases the code-point\(s\) becomes a character code in the DFDL Information Item for the string.

### 11.2.3 Preserving Data Containing Decoding Errors

There can be situations where data wants to be preserved exactly even if it contains errors.

It is suggested that if a DFDL schema author wants to preserve information containing data where the encodings have these kinds of errors, that they model such data as xs:hexBinary, or as xs:string but using an encoding such as iso-8859-1 which preserves all bytes.

## 11.3 Byte Order and Bit Order

Byte order and bit order are separate concepts. However, of the possible combinations, only the following are allowed:

1. ‘bigEndian’ with ‘mostSignificantBitFirst’
2. ‘littleEndian’ with ‘mostSignificantBitFirst’
3. ‘littleEndian’ with ‘leastSignificantBitFirst’ \[31\]

Other combinations MUST produce Schema Definition Errors.

\[31\] Used by data format MIL-STD-2045

## 11.4 dfdl:bitOrder Example

Consider a structure of 4 logical elements. The total length is 16 bits.

Assume the lengths here are measured in bits \(dfdl:lengthUnits\[32\] is 'bits'\), and that these are binary integers \(dfdl:representation is 'binary', dfdl:binaryNumberRep\[33\] is 'binary'\):

`<element name="A" type="xs:int" dfdl:length="3"/> <!-- having value 3 -->  
<element name="B" type="xs:int" dfdl:length="7"/> <!-- having value 9 -->  
<element name="C" type="xs:int" dfdl:length="4"/> <!-- having value 5 -->  
<element name="D" type="xs:int" dfdl:length="2"/> <!-- having value 1 -->`

The above are colorized to highlight the corresponding bits in the data below.

In a format where dfdl:bitOrder is 'mostSignificantBitFirst':

               `01100010 01010101  
               AAABBBBB BBCCCCDD  
Significance   M      L M      L  
Bit Position   12345678 12345678  
Byte Position  ----1--- ----2---`

As presented here, the bits corresponding to each element appear left to right, and all bits for an individual element are adjacent. Within the bits of an individual element the most significant bit is on the left, least significant on the right, consistent with the way the bytes themselves are presented.

In contrast, in a format where dfdl:bitOrder is 'leastSignificantBitFirst':

               `01001011 01010100  
               BBBBBAAA DDCCCCBB  
Significance   M      L M      L  
Bit Position   87654321 87654321  
Byte Position  ----1--- ----2---`

In the above presentation note how the bits of the element 'B' do not appear adjacent to each other. The most significant bits of byte N are adjacent to the least significant bits of byte N+1.

\[32\] For dfdl:lengthUnits, see Section 12.3 Properties for Specifying Lengths. 

\[33\] For dfdl:binaryNumberRep, see Section 13.7 Properties Specific to Number with Binary Representation.

### 11.4.1 Example Using Right-to-Left Display for 'leastSignificantBitFirst'

When working exclusively with data having dfdl:bitOrder 'leastSignificantBitFirst', it is useful to present data with bytes Right to Left. That is, with the bytes starting at byte 1 on the right and increasing to the left.

                `01010100 01001011  
                DDCCCCBB BBBBBAAA  
Significance    M      L M      L  
Bit Position    87654321 87654321  
Byte Position   ----2--- ----1---`

With this reorientation, the bits of the element 'B' are once again displayed adjacently. Within the bits of an individual element the most significant bit is on the left, least significant on the right, consistent with the way the bytes themselves are presented.

Often the specification documents for data formats that with least-significant-bit-first bit order will describe data using this Right-to-Left presentation style.

### 11.4.2 dfdl:bitOrder and Grammar Regions

When any grammar region appears before \(to the left of\) or after \(to the right of\) another grammar region in the grammar rules of Section 9.3, and the boundary between the two falls within a byte rather than on a byte boundary, then the dfdl:bitOrder determines which bits are occupied by the regions.

In general, the notion of _before_ means occupying lower-numbered bit positions, and the bit positions are numbered according to dfdl:bitOrder. Hence, when dfdl:bitOrder is 'mostSignificantBitFirst', grammar regions that are before, will occupy more-significant bits, and when dfdl:bitOrder is 'leastSignificantBitFirst', grammar regions that are before will occupy less-significant bits.
